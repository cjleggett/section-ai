# Section Materials for CSCI S-80

For each section, there will be a directory with that section's number (`0` for section 0), and sub-directories labeled `distro` for distribution code, `section` for code I edited during section, and `solution` for solutions to in-class exercises.

Slides for the class can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11rVKHwVlncmSfDwcNqwjaBIcRgmIRVYQ?usp=sharing)!
